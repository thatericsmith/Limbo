Limbo is a minimalist theme for [Convergence CMS](http://convergencecms.co/), specifically enhanced for version 3. Limbo uses [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) for design and layout elements and should be a great boilerplate for any website relying on the bootstrap framework.

This version of Limbo was designed for Bootstrap version 3.x and has several cusomizations within the Convergence CMS Platform to ensure it works seemlessly with this software.

#### Installation:

To install this theme on your next Convergence project, copy the site files into your site directory. Once you have uploaded the new site files to your server, you should have a fresh boilerplate for your new website. Remember to also delete any existing CSS and HTML files in your directory as these could overwrite some of the styles in this theme. Existing HTML files in your Convergence files should be replaced with the themed versions in the Limbo installation folder.

#### Features:

In addition to Bootstrap, there are a few custom functionalities built in to give you more flexability with your content. I'm currently adding new features, but here's whats included so far:

##### Accordion Widget:
This is a simple accordion widget that works with the Convergence Blog module. To use it, just select the "Accordion" option in the Settings menu for "How do you want your Blog displayed" in your Blog Module. You can change the styles in the global.css file.

##### Warning

Please note that you should NOT delete the original "photos" folder in your Convergence directory as this will cause issues with your site.

#### Licensing:

This theme is free to use for all projects both personal and commercial so long as you keep the commented author information at the top of the included stylesheets. If you like Limbo, give us a shout! We'd love to hear your feedback and suggestions. Also, feel free to jump over to GitHub and fork this theme.
